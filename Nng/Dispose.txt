The Dispose Pattern in C++/CLI

Disposing of data is not really a problem in C++, as it destroys objects as they go out of scope. But we want to use the Assembly from C#.

You cannot implement a member called "Dispose" in C++/CLI. It is created automatically. And the automatically
generated method "Dispose" calls the destructor.

The C++/CLI destructor will also contain automatically added code to execute SuppressFinalize().

As the Nng library contains a lot of things that should be stopped deterministically, I chose not to implement
a finalizer.
